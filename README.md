This is what the output resume looks like.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

1. Once you clone the repo navigate into it on your local machine
2. Edit the `cv.yaml` file with the relevant information.
3. When done simply type in your terminal `make` which will output a file `cv.pdf` that you can use.
    * Note that once you invoke `make` command it will overwrite your `cv.pdf` file so just in case back it up into the `archive` directory.
