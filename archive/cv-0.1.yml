experience:
- company: Company A 
  title: Machine Learning Summoner
  dates: "Aug 1919 -- Jan 1923"
  location: "New York, NY"
  details:
    - 'Developed some super crazy reinforcement learning system that allows robots to walk and fight.'
    - 'Created an implementation of some super sick algorithm with various policies using Numpy which became the prediction service of the reinforcement learning system.'
    - 'Implemented an event driven architecture using Redis Queue and an artifical central neural system as opposed to a monolithic one which led to improved maintainability and scalability as well as the improved latency for signals.'
    - 'Developed producers and consumers and deployed them as AWS lambda functions that communicated with each other via a Kinesis message stream which improved the monitoring of the system and service uptime.'  
    - 'Implemented containerization strategies using Kubernetes and Docker to create a deployment environment that resulted in enhanced scalability, performance, and reliability of the reinforcement learning system.'
